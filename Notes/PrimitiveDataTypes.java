/* Primitive Data Types
 * 
 * int - Integer (32 bit - no decimal points) Examples: -5, 314, -3 
 *      Max Value (2^31 - 1) - About 2.1 billion
 *      WATCH FOR INTEGER OVERFLOW! (When it gets too large)
 * double - number with decimal places - 64 bits
 *      Can introduce error in accuracy because of lack of memory
 * boolean - true/false
 * string* - Really isn't primitive, but acts like one
 * 
 * float* - number with decimal places - 32 bits
 * char* - A single character
 * long* - an integer.
 *      Max Value (2^63 - 1)
 * short* - an integer. - 16 bits
 *      Max Value (2^15 - 1)
 * byte* - an integer.- 8 bits [-128,127]
 *      Max Value (2^7 -1)
 * 
 * viod - absence of ...anything 
 * null - the lack of reference
